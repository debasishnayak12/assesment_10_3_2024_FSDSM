>>>Six Sigma is a statistical methodology and quality management approach
    aimed at improving processes and reducing defects and variations within 
    a product or service. It emphasizes a data-driven, systematic,
    and disciplined approach to problem-solving and process improvement.

>>>The term "Six Sigma" refers to a level of quality that strives to ensure 
    that defects occur at a rate of less than 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO). 
    The sigma (Ïƒ) symbol represents the standard deviation, which is a measure of the 
    variation in a process. Achieving Six Sigma quality means that the process has very 
    little variation and is highly predictable.
>>>Example--
    Suppose a manufacturing company produces electronic components.
    One of their critical processes is soldering, where components are 
    soldered onto circuit boards. However, they have been experiencing defects
    such as soldering defects, misalignments, and component damage.
