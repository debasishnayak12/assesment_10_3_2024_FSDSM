>>>Data that do not have a log-normal distribution or a Gaussian distribution are
    typically those that do not follow a symmetric, bell-shaped curve in their probability 
    density function (PDF). These distributions are commonly observed in many natural phenomena
    and human-made processes, but not all data fit these patterns.

>>>One common example of data that do not follow a log-normal or 
    Gaussian distribution is count data, which can often have a skewed 
    distribution due to their discrete nature. Count data represent the 
    number of occurrences of an event within a certain time frame, space, or category. For example:

    1-The number of customer complaints received by a company in a day.
    2-The number of defects found in a batch of manufactured products.
    3-The number of accidents at a particular intersection within a week.

>>>Types of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles).
    Colors of products (e.g., red, blue, green).
    Levels of satisfaction (e.g., satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied). these are some example
